#| output-location: fragment

weight = 150
print(weight)
```

## Variables for Strings


```{python}

#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

name = "Uzair"
print(name)
```

## If, Elif, Else Statements

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

buy_score = 0
donut_condition = "not fresh"
donut_price = "low"

if donut_condition == "fresh":
  buy_score = 10
elif donut_price == "low":
  buy_score = 5
else:
  buy_score = 0

print(buy_score)
```

## for Loops

- Suppose you want to check if a particular city is one of the 5 environmentally
cleanest in the U.S


- You've assigned the name of the city in question to the variable city_to_check. For example, you wroteâ€¦

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

city_to_check = "Tucson"
```

- And you've assigned the names of the 5 cleanest cities to the **list** `cleanest_cities`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

cleanest_cities = ["Cheyenne", "Santa Fe", "Tucson", "Great Falls", "Honolulu"]
```


## How to check if cleanest_cities have city_to_check ?

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

for a_clean_city in cleanest_cities:
  if city_to_check == a_clean_city:
    print("It's one of the cleanest cities")
    break
```


- Things to notice:
- Line 1 ends in a colon.
- Line 2 is indented, because it takes its orders from Line 1.
- Line 3 has a deeper indent than Line 2, because it takes its orders from Line 2.

## break statement

- In the course of comparing the city in question against the list of clean cities, if Python finds a match, there's no point in continuing the loop.

- So you stop the loop by adding a `break` statement

## for Loops nested

- We can also run nested loops in Python


## Example

```{python}

#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

first_names = ["Uzair ", "Ayesha ", "Abdul ", "Ali ", "Abdullah"]
last_names = ["Aslam", "Imran", "Samad", "Imran"]
full_names = []
for a_first_name in first_names:
  for a_last_name in last_names:
    full_names.append(a_first_name + " " + a_last_name)
print(full_names)
```


- The `inner loop` runs a complete cycle of iterations on each iteration of the `outer loop`.
- The total combinations we get are 4 * 5 = 20
